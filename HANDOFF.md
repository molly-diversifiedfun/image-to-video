# HANDOFF — make-video build (audio + transitions)

**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Branches (pushed, awaiting merge to main):** `feat/prd-1-slideshow`, `chore/brew-setup-docs`. PRD-3 already merged to main at `2695772`.
**Milestones:** PRD-5 (photo+audio), PRD-2 (seamless loop-extend), PRD-3 (clip+soundtrack), AND PRD-1 (slideshow) COMPLETE. **4 of 5 shipped.** 110/110 tests. Only PRD-4 (multi-clip mixer) remains.

> **PRD-1 slideshow (2026-06-18):** New `lib/slideshow.sh::xfade_join` — a folder of images → ONE long video, each held then crossfaded into the next. Trigger: `--slideshow` on a directory (default folder behavior = batch, preserved). Flags: `--each HOURS`, `--xfade`, `--shuffle`/`--seed`, `--fill`, `--audio`. Total = n·each − (n−1)·xfade. Fast: holds use the encode-once+concat-copy trick (`_slideshow_build_hold`, mirrors `make_static`) so render time is O(1) in hold length — **review caught a perf bug where holds re-encoded every frame (17.9s vs 4.2s for a 120s hold @1080p); fixed.** Teeth tests: dissolve-not-a-hard-cut with a hard-cut negative control (PSNR ~40 dB dissolve vs ~12 dB hard cut), junk-file skip via duration discrimination, long-hold (>30s) test forcing the concat-copy path. On branch `feat/prd-1-slideshow`; merge when ready.

> **PRD-3 (2026-06-18, MERGED `2695772`):** `--keep-native` layers the `--audio` music bed OVER a clip's native sound via `mux_audio_layer` (ffmpeg `amix`); default stays replace. Teeth: bandpass-RMS tone helpers (`assert_tone_present/absent`, -35 dB) + negative controls.

> **Brew cleanup (2026-06-18):** Friend now has Homebrew + Xcode, so the zero-install constraint is relaxed. Docs reordered to lead with `brew install ffmpeg` (resolution already falls back to PATH — verified end-to-end on brew ffmpeg 8.0.1). Bundled `bin/` + `setup-mac-arm64.sh` kept as the portable/no-install alternative. On branch `chore/brew-setup-docs`. **NOTE: zero-install is no longer a hard constraint — PRD-4 may use Python if bash sequencing gets ugly.**

> Real-smoke on the operator's actual media still blocked on the unmounted SSD (same as the drive sync). bats runs the real tool on generated media as the available smoke.
**Method:** subagent-driven development (implementer → spec review → code-quality review → fix loop), per `docs/plans/2026-06-18-make-video-implementation.md`.

## Goal
Extend the existing bash `make-video` (still→long silent video) into a unified, input-routed tool with audio + seam-checked transitions, per the 5 PRDs in `docs/prds/`. Runtime is **bash + bundled ffmpeg only** (friend's Mac has no Python/Homebrew — zero-install is a hard constraint). Dev tests use `bats` + `ffprobe`/PSNR/RMS.

## Done (Phase 0–1 core + start of Phase 2)
- **Task 0** — bats harness: `tests/helpers/fixtures.sh` (`mk_image/mk_clip/mk_audio`, `$FFMPEG`/`$FFPROBE` resolution), `tests/helpers/assert.sh` (`assert_duration/assert_has_stream/assert_seam_ok`). Review caught a Critical: seam check silently passed on ffmpeg error — fixed.
- **Tasks 1+2** — `lib/classify.sh::classify_input` (image|video|image-dir|video-dir|unknown), `lib/duration.sh::parse_duration` (hours→secs, validated).
- **Task 3** — `lib/mux.sh::mux_audio VIDEO AUDIO OUT` — `-c:v copy` (proven), AAC `-b:a 192k`, audio REPLACE via explicit `-map`. CALLER CONTRACT: AUDIO must be pre-fit to video length (`-shortest` truncates otherwise).
- **Task 4** — `lib/audio.sh::audio_build SRC TARGET_SECS OUT` (single-file branch): trims if long, click-free `acrossfade` self-seamless loop if short, `loudnorm` I=-16. Dir branch is a stub returning non-zero. Review caught TWO real bugs: (1) seam test was toothless (peak-over-200ms can't see a click) → rewritten to RMS-delta in a 1ms window WITH a negative-control test that proves a hard loop FAILS; (2) sample-rate hardcoded 44100 broke 48 kHz sources → now queries actual sample rate.

- **Task 5** — `lib/audio.sh` folder branch: `audio_build DIR …` → crossfaded, per-track-loudness-normalized playlist (sorted or `--shuffle --seed N`), looped to fill, exact duration. Teeth-tested (40 LUFS raw disparity would fail; per-track loudnorm → 0.92 LUFS).
- **PRD-5 (Tasks 7–8)** — `--audio PATH` wired into `make-video` still mode (single file → loop; folder → playlist). Video stream stays `-c:v copy` (static path) or muxes onto the zoom re-encode. No-`--audio` path is byte-for-byte unchanged (regression-tested). Real-smoked on the actual 4K fine-art TIFF + audio → h264+aac, exact duration. Temp-dir cleanup guaranteed on all exit paths (RETURN traps don't fire under `set -e` script-exit, so explicit `|| { cleanup; return 1; }`).

- **`loop_unit`** (`lib/loop.sh`) — builds ONE loop unit per `--loop pingpong|crossfade|native`, encode-once. Honesty-verified: pingpong truly seamless (boundary ≈ baseline), crossfade hides flash only (+13 dB over hard cut, NOT seamless), native = as-is.
- **`seam_check`** (`lib/seam.sh`) — runtime reporter: boundary-vs-baseline PSNR → SEAMLESS/SOFT/VISIBLE; teeth-tested (hard cut → VISIBLE); rejects FRAME<12 (degenerate-baseline false-pass guard).
- **PRD-2 (loop-extend mode)** — single video clip → `loop_unit` → concat-copy `-t` to ~exact target (Δ<0.1s real) → PREVIEW GATE (`seam_check` at the real wrap frame via `nb_read_packets`, prints verdict + emits a seam-preview clip; recommends pingpong only when verdict≠SEAMLESS AND not already pingpong; never hangs in non-TTY/`--yes`). Native audio looped through the unit; `--audio` replaces. `--zoom` rejected for video. Temp cleanup on all exit paths.

All committed; `bats tests/` = **98/98 green**. Run: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"; bats tests/`.

## Key decisions / lessons
- **Seam strategy is evidence-based** (red-team, architecture §3.2): crossfade hides the flash but leaves a content jump (28.6 dB); pingpong is truly seamless (≈baseline) but reverses motion; loop-native source is the third option. `--loop {crossfade|pingpong|native}`.
- **Tests must have teeth**: two separate review rounds caught tests that passed on broken code (Task 0 seam helper; Task 4 seam test). Every seam/quality test now needs a negative control proving it fails on the bad case.
- PRD-4 (multi-clip mixer) is gated to ship LAST (slow full re-encode).

## Remaining (resume here)
Phases 0–3 DONE: shared core + PRD-5 (photo+audio) + PRD-2 (seamless loop-extend). 2 of 5 features shipped.
- **PRD-3** (clip + soundtrack) — THIN: it's PRD-2's loop-extend video + the `--audio` path already wired (file→loop, folder→playlist), with audio REPLACE as the default for clips (drone hum unwanted) and `--keep-native` to layer. Mostly a default-flip + a couple tests. Likely the next quick win.
- **PRD-1** (slideshow) — new `xfade_join` engine: chain per-image still segments (each held N hours) with crossfades into ONE video; `--each`, `--shuffle`; few seams so fast.
- **PRD-4** (multi-clip mixer) — LAST: `clip_sequencer` (shuffle, no adjacent repeat, `--seed`) + normalize-to-project + `xfade_join` chain (full GPU re-encode, slow) + mandatory preview + `--hardcut` fast fallback.

NOTE: not yet merged to `main`; drive copy at `/Volumes/1TB SSD/ImageToVideo/` still has the OLD silent-only tool — re-sync (lib/ + new make-video) when ready to hand off.

## Definition of Done — status (as of 67988ae)
- [x] Code complete for PRD-5 + PRD-2; every engine + mode implemented
- [x] Tests: **98/98 bats green**; each engine/mode unit + integration tested with negative controls (teeth)
- [x] Lint: `shellcheck -S warning make-video lib/*.sh setup-mac-arm64.sh` → clean (exit 0)
- [x] Security: no secrets committed; ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries gitignored (reproduce via `setup-mac-arm64.sh`)
- [x] Verification: every task passed two-stage review (spec + code-quality) with fix loops; reviewers re-ran tests
- [x] Production smoke: PRD-5 real-smoked on the actual 4K fine-art TIFF + audio; PRD-2 real-smoked on a motion clip with `--loop pingpong` (preview reported SEAMLESS, output 36s h264+aac)
- [x] Docs current: README.md, README.txt, architecture, 5 PRDs, implementation plan, this HANDOFF
- [x] Branch pushed to origin
- [x] **Merged to `main`** and pushed (merge commit; `main` at `345cd06`+).
- [ ] **Drive copy NOT yet synced** — the external SSD was unmounted at ship time. When it's reconnected, run `./sync-to-drive.sh` (defaults to `/Volumes/1TB SSD/ImageToVideo`) to copy `make-video` + `lib/` + `README.txt` (bundled ffmpeg already on the drive), then smoke from the drive with a clean PATH.
- N/A: registry-membership (no registry pattern in this project)

## Recurring lesson (worth a `/learn`)
The review gates caught **7 bugs that all had green tests**: silent-pass seam helper, toothless seam test, 48 kHz sample-rate click, toothless loudness test, temp-dir leak, preview gate reading the wrong frame, circular pingpong tip. The pattern: a green test isn't a passing test unless it has a **negative control** that fails on the broken case. Every seam/loudness/quality test in this repo now ships with one.

## Resume instructions
1. `cd ~/github/ImageToVideo && git checkout feat/audio-and-transitions && git pull`
2. `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" && bats tests/` → expect 53/53.
3. Continue subagent-driven from Task 5 (full text in `docs/plans/2026-06-18-make-video-implementation.md`). Keep the two-stage review + negative-control discipline.
4. The deployed tool + bundled ffmpeg live on the friend's drive at `/Volumes/1TB SSD/ImageToVideo/` (binaries gitignored; reproduce with `setup-mac-arm64.sh`). Re-sync the drive copy after the feature lands.
